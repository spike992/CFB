  soviet.2999.d:0 "The Dance of the Marshalls will determine what your build for Barb will look like. 3 paths are locked till after the Winter War so look carefully at their conditions and adapt to changing conditions. In 1942 you will regain flexibility. Please look at the decisions in the decision tab for more details.\n\n\nIf new to the soviets pick Semyon Timoshenko for your Marshal."
  soviet.3000.t:0 "Who was Grigory Khulik?"
  soviet.3000.d:0 "Grigory Khulik was an incomptent soviet Field Marshall in charge of the artillery and their poor performance in the Winter War. He actively worked to slow down the production of T34 and KV1 tank series by using his position to slow down the production of ammo for the tanks. §G"What the hell do we need rocket artillery for? The main thing is the horse-drawn gun."§! He failed to prevent the encirclement of Lenningrad and was dismissed in 41 along with Voroshilov.\n\nHis path is only accessible by Winning the Winter War without needing the buff the Soviets get at half casualties. His path grants Calvary or TD bonuses, and picking him under the Voroshilov path focuses on Heavy Artillery"
  soviet.3001.t:0 "Who was Killment Voroshilov?"
  soviet.3001.d:0 "Killment Voroshilov was a more political guy, he was incompetent but was good politically and so survived his poor performance in WW even though people didn't like him much. He was still made the scapegoat though and was made to be 'Deputy Premier responsible for cultural matters' and while given command again after Barbarossa after his failure to prevent the encirclement of Lenningrad he was dismissed by Zhukov in 41 along with Khulik.\n\nWinning the winter war will allow you to go down his path, focused on Heavy Artillery or Light Tanks, or a neutral path with no specialization. Picking him under Timeshenko will also lead to that neutral path."
  soviet.3002.t:0 "Who was Semyon Timoshenko?"
  soviet.3002.d:0 "Semyon Timoshenko was the Marshall brought in to salvage the Winter War after Voroshilov's Failing's, and was able to organize a succesfull soviet series of offensives to win the war. While more traditional minded than the other reformists, he nontheless saw a need to modernize the Soviet Military. He was initially assigned the center during the defense of Barbarossa but was eventually given control of the entire southern half of the front when Zhokov was given control of the North.\n\nHis path is the historical path and is always available, granting more generic bonuses. You may also get Blyukher with this path."
  soviet.3003.t:0 "Who was Vasily Blyukher?"
  soviet.3003.d:0 "Vasily Blyukher was a field marshal who was a reformer of Soviet Doctrine. He was close friends with Tuchchekvsky and believed in the modernization of the army. He was the first Soviet Officer to use Aircraft to scout for artillery. He was in charge of the Far East during the border war in the Battle of Lake Khasan, and the soviet unpreparedness there caused him to get purged.\n\nYou can choose to keep Bluhkyr in the semi-historical path, or you can take full control with him if the winter war is lost by the leaders of the traditional russian tactics. He goes heavy into the Modernization of the Soviet Army and grants lots of bonuses to that end. You can also save Tuchchekvsky with his path."
  soviet.3004.t:0 "Who was Semyon Budyonny?"
  soviet.3004.d:0 "Semyon Budyonny was an old fart Calvary leader who believed speed was the most important thing and was generally incomptenet. He was the one responsible for the encirclements at Kiev and while removed from Active Military Service Stalin kep him from being purged. §G"Budyonny never knew much, and he never studied anything. He showed himself to be completely incompetent and permitted awful mistakes to be made." - Konev§!\n\nUnder Khulik his path is to focus on Calvary, and under the Voroshilov path his focus is on the BT Program of light tanks"
  soviet.3005.t:0 "Who was Alexander Yegorov?"
  soviet.3005.d:0 "Alexander Yegorov was a Field Marshall who was purged in 1939, and believed that tanks were over-rated. He believed that the future was in Mobile Anti Tank guns and better hand-held Anti-Tank equipment. He only survived the purges as long as he did due to a personal connection with Stalin but his perofrmance during the Polish Soviet War from the 20's was recieving considerable rebuke and thus he was killed.\n\nHis path grants bonuses to Tank Destorers and AT equipment."
  soviet.3006.t:0 "Who was Mikhail Tukhachevsky?"
  soviet.3006.d:0 "Mikhail Tukhachevsky was a reform minded Soviet Field Marshal who heavily pushed the Deep Operations style of doctrine and pushed for the strong need for Modernization of the soviet Army. His work was slowly being incorporated into Soviet Doctrine but was stalled when he was purged in 1937.\n\nIf during the "Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization" you elect to have Trostky Spared for the Stability hit, you can have him as an option if you lose the Winter War."

  soviet.3008.t:0 "Losing the Winter War"
  soviet.3008.d:0 "To be blunt, this path is only designed for soviets who are playing poorly and will need a boost to ensure they don't get crushed when Barb happens. They are given good field marshalls and stats to make up for their poor performance. It would not be unreasonable for some servers to choose to ban this path depending on their play preference."
